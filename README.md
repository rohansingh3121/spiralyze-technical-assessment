# Spiralyze Technical Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains the completed technical assessment for the Spiralyze <> Front-End Developer. The goal of this task was to replicate a Figma mockup exactly, ensuring pixel-perfect alignment, behavior and functionality using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no libraries).

## Features Implemented
1. **Figma Design Replication**: 
   - The design was faithfully recreated according to the Figma file shared in the assignment.
   - All assets, fonts and layout structures were replicated.

2. **Hover Effects**: 
   - Hover effects were added to the main menu items (Home menu) and footer links, matching the provided design’s specifications.

3. **Country Dropdown**: 
   - A dropdown list of countries was implemented in the form, ensuring it's populated as per the given requirements.

4. **Play Button**: 
   - A play button was added that triggers a video to autoplay once clicked or tapped. The video is not embedded as the background but is a separate, clickable element.

5. **Thank You Page**: 
   - A custom “Thank You” page was designed and implemented, which appears after the form is successfully submitted.
